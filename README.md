### What is `powerly`?

>`powerly` is an `R` package that implements the method by [Constantin et al.
(2021)](https://psyarxiv.com/j5v7u) for conducting sample size analysis for
cross-sectional network models. The method implemented is implemented in the
main function `powerly()`. The implementation takes the form of a three-step
recursive algorithm designed to find an optimal sample size value given a model
specification and an outcome measure of interest. It starts with a Monte Carlo
simulation step for computing the outcome at various sample sizes. It continues
with a monotone curve-fitting step for interpolating the outcome. The final step
employs stratified bootstrapping to quantify the uncertainty around the fitted
curve. For more details on how the method works, check the manuscript linked
above. Moreover, consult the [method
poster](https://github.com/mihaiconstantin/powerly#poster).
